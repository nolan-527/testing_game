In order to find out what went wrong, your company decided to perform an audit, and security log analysis to understand what was done in response or if anything had been detected. It was found that the user you decided to ignore, was actually a newly created account by the threat actor and that was the reason for the breach. Due to your lack of proper procedures, the company was breached resulting in a class action lawsuit against the company. You have been terminated.\n\n\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⢡\n\n\n",
